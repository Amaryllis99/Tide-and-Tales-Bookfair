For this first edition of the **Tide and Tales Bookfair**, we're offering a wide range of activities: meetings with your favorite authors, contests, exclusive interviews...  
Each day will feature two interviews with an author/creator duo. The first will take place in the morning from 10am to 12pm, and the second in the early afternoon. These events will take place on the main stage at Les Capucins, and will be an opportunity for you to learn more about the process of writing a novel, or the machinery behind the success of an account dedicated to literature.  
But these interviews won't be your only opportunity to interact with the festival guests! Each of our 12 guests will have their own stand, so you can chat with them over the three days of the festival.  
See you then,
